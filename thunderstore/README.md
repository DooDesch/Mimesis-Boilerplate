> A starter template for building MelonLoader mods for MIMESIS. Clone it, rename it, and you have a ready-to-build mod skeleton that matches the project conventions.

This is a developer template, not a player-facing feature mod. Installing it does nothing in game - it only logs that it initialized. If you are a player, there is nothing to configure here. If you are a modder, use it as the starting point for a new Mimesis mod.

## Features

- Minimal `MelonMod` entry point that initializes preferences and runs `HarmonyInstance.PatchAll()` - no game behavior is patched.
- MelonPreferences config scaffold demonstrating the standard preferences pattern.
- A fully commented-out Harmony patch stub showing the Prefix/Postfix pattern (not compiled by default).
- A one-command setup script that renames the project to your mod name and removes the template Git history.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that builds on a version tag and publishes to GitHub Releases and Thunderstore.
- Optional MimicAPI integration pre-wired but disabled - uncomment to enable.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| MIMESIS | 0.3.0 (current Steam build) |
| MelonLoader | 0.7.3+ |

## Installation

- Recommended: install via a Thunderstore mod manager (r2modman or Gale).
- Manual: download the package, extract `Boilerplate.dll` into `MIMESIS/Mods/`, and launch once to generate the config.

## Configuration

Stored in `UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg` under the `Boilerplate` category.

| Option | Description | Default | Values/Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Enabled` | Enable Boilerplate functionality. When disabled, the mod will not modify game behavior. The template only logs this value. | `true` | boolean (true/false) |

## Usage

There is no in-game usage and no keybinds. This is a developer template - it produces no visible effect in game.

For the full setup guide (rename script, build steps, GitHub Actions, and optional MimicAPI), see the repository:
